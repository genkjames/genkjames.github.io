From Stopwatch Tower to a 3 Time Frame featuring a game of Tic Tac Toe, you will get an up-close look at the most exciting sculptures this tour has to offer. With fun facts shared along the way you will leave with bits of knowledge you might not have heard of before. With that said, <span class="font-color">hop aboard</span> and experience this journey with me!!</p>

Go ahead, you can test it out if you would like, but please make sure you return before the train leaves the station. I would hate to see you miss out on the rest of the tour.</p>

					<p><span class="fun_fact">Fun Fact </span> The Stopwatch gang was a group of three Canadians who robbed over 140 banks in the US and Canada. During their time of fraud, they were able to steal around 15 <span class="font-color italics">million</span> dollars.</p>

					<p>But why did the FBI decide to call them the <span class="font-color">Stopwatch</span> gang? Well, the leader was always spotted wearing a stopwatch around his neck. And since it took around 90 to 120 seconds for them to get in and out of banks, they most likely used that stopwatch to time their robberies.</p>

					<p><span class="fun_fact">Fun Fact </span> Here are a few facts about math to keep this interesting. The first handheld calculator was invented by <span class="font-color">Texas Instruments</span> in 1967. I'm sure we are all familiar with this company.</p>

					<p>From 0 to 1,000, the letter <span class="font-color">"A"</span> only appears in 1,000 ("one thous<span class="font-color">a</span>nd").</p>

					<p>And last but not least, the answer to the question <span class="font-color">2 x 17 x 11059</span>, from before, is <span class="font-color">376006</span>. It is composed of three distinct prime numbers multiplied together and has a total of eight divisors. Also, when viewed upside down it looks like the word <span class="font-color">google</span>.</p>

How fast can you click on the object that pops up? <span class="font-color">My shortest time is currently 0.434 seconds.</span> Give it a try and see if you can beat it. Once you are satisfied with your score you can always turn the TV off.</p>

Well, studies have shown that having a fast reaction can not only help you move out of a path of danger, but could also be <span class="font-color">linked with lower mortality</span>. Whereas, people with slower reaction times had a higher mortality rate and were at greater risk of dying from a heart attack.</p>
